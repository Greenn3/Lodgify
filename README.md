# **Lodgify Server ‚Äì REST API for Property Management**  

## Overview  
Lodgify Server is the **backend for a client-server property management system (PMS)**, built for a specific accommodation facility. It is developed in **Java with Spring Framework** and follows a **REST API architecture** with controllers, services, and repositories.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This API is my very first REST API built with Spring, so it is **not perfect** and not fully aligned with best practices ‚Äî and I‚Äôm aware of that.  
I have already applied improved design and coding standards in another project: [SyncCart](https://github.com/Greenn3/SyncCart).  

I plan to refactor this API to follow cleaner architecture and better conventions, and to rebuild the frontend as a modern web application.


The system handles the **core business logic**, including:  
- Managing **reservations** (adding, modifying, deleting)  
- **Price calculations** based on stay period & accommodation type  
- Managing **pricing lists & accommodation types**  
- Handling **data storage in a MySQL database**  

The server is **self-hosted on a VPS** and can be accessed at:  
üñ• **[80.211.200.112:8090](http://80.211.200.112:8090)**  

Since the API does not have a UI, it requires the **Lodgify Desktop Client** to interact with it:
