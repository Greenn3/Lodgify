# **Lodgify Server – REST API for Property Management**  

## Overview  
Lodgify Server is the **backend for a client-server property management system (PMS)**, built for a specific accommodation facility. It is developed in **Java with Spring Framework** and follows a **REST API architecture** with controllers, services, and repositories.  

The system handles the **core business logic**, including:  
- Managing **reservations** (adding, modifying, deleting)  
- **Price calculations** based on stay period & accommodation type  
- Managing **pricing lists & accommodation types**  
- Handling **data storage in a MySQL database**  

The server is **self-hosted on a VPS** and can be accessed at:  
🖥 **[80.211.200.112:8090](http://80.211.200.112:8090)**  

Since the API does not have a UI, it requires the **Lodgify Desktop Client** to interact with it:
